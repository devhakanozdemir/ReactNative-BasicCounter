# ReactNative-BasicCounter

It's a single page - basic counter app. 
<br><br>
* It has default -100 and +100 for minimum and maximum counter limit. You can change them by TextInputs.
  <br><br>
* (+) and (-) buttons created by Pressable component. They incremenet and decrement the counter. Additionally you can reset the counter with a "RESET" button that created by Pressable component. We manipulate them with useState functions.
  <br><br>
* When the counter reaches to limits, buttons will disable and counter will stop by using If / Else statements.
